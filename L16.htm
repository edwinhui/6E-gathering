<h1>Q16.</h1>
<h2>16. Learning poetry in English lessons- a letter to the editor</h2>
<p>While many students complain about the boredom of learning English poetry, </p>
<p>I see the advantages of acquiring knowledge about poems in English lessons. </p>
<p>In this letter, I would like to draw the readers' attention to the pros of learning English poetry.</p>
<p>Some people may argue that it is always better for students to spend more time on grammar learning and exam practices.</p> 
<p>Undoubtedly, practice makes perfect. </p>
<p>All the above activities do prepare students better for different assessments and exams. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, learning a language is not for assessments alone. </p>
<p>It is for communication purposes. </p>
<p>When we leave school, I believe there are many chances for us to use English in our social life, </p>
<p>like going to an opera or writing a poem for special occasions. </p>
<p>Then, the knowledge of poetry will be of great use.</p>
