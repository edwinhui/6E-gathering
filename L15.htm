<h1>Q15.</h1>
<h2>15. Nuclear power is the best source of energy for the future- a debate speech </h2>
<p>I'm Chris Wong from F. 6E, one of the members of the Debating Club. </p>
<p>The motion of this debating contest is: nuclear power is the best source of energy for the future. </p>
<p>By 'nuclear energy, radioactive materials, such as Uranium-235, are used as raw materials to generate electricity. </p>
<p>Through a process called "Nuclear Fission', a large amount of heat is released, </p>
<p>and the heat is used to boil water to steam, which is used to start up the generator for electricity production. </p>
<p>But, is it the best way? Towards today's motion, I staunchly agree that nuclear power is the best source of energy for the future,</p> 
<p>and I'd like to support my stance with the following points of view.</p>
